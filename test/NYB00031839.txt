TITLE  OF  BILL:    An  act to amend the executive law, in relation to
providing for the award of attorney's fees and expert witness fees  in
appropriate cases

PURPOSE OF BILL:

This  bill  would  amend the Executive Law. to provide for an award of
attorney's fees and expert witness fees in all  appropriate  cases  of
discrimination.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS:

Section 1 of the bill would amend Executive Law S 297 (10) to omit the
phrase  "(w)ith  respect  to cases of housing discrimination only," so
that attorney's fees. may be  awarded  in  all  appropriate  cases  of
discrimination   and   to   provide   that,  in  cases  of  employment
discrimination only, the award of attorney's fees will be  limited  to
cases  in  which  the  employer has 50 or more employees. This section
would also provide for expert witness fees to be awarded  pursuant  to
the same standards as an award of attorney's fees.

Section  2  would  provide that the bill will become effective 90 days
after enactment.

EXISTING LAW:

Currently attorney's fees may be awarded  only  in  cases  of  housing
discrimination. There are no provisions for expert witness fees.

STATEMENT IN SUPPORT

In  order  to  create  uniformity and consistency within the Executive
Law, the limitation on the provision of  attorney's  fees  to  housing
discrimination  cases should he removed so that attorney's fees can be
awarded  in  appropriate  cases  in  other  areas  of  the  Division's
jurisdiction, such as employment and places of public accommodation.

The  majority  of  cases  filed under the Executive Law are employment
cases. Often, discrimination victims have been terminated,  or  forced
to  leave  their  jobs  because  of  intolerable  conditions  .such as
pervasive sexual harassment, and are frequently not in a  position  to
pay  for  legal representation. Although the law provides for Division
attorneys or agents to present cases at a public hearing when probable
cause has been found, there are no provisions for legal representation
in  the  investigation  and  conciliation  stages  of   the   Division
proceedings,  nor  are there provisions for representation for persons
who pursue their claims directly in State court.

A provision for an award of attorney's fees in  employment  and  other
discrimination  cases would be consistent with the discrimination laws
of many other  states,  as  well  federal  law,  and  would  permit  a
more-robust  enforcement  of  the  law  for the general benefit of the
public.  A wards for expenditure of fees for expert  witnesses  should
be  awarded  in  a  like  manner,  so  that the Division will have the
benefit of a complete record in making its determinations.


LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:  2011-12- A.1860- Referred to Codes
2009-10-  A.8184-  Passed  Assembly/S.3884- Referred to Investigations
and Governmental Operations

FISCAL IMPLICATIONS:

None to the State.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

This proposal would take effect 90 days after becoming law.
